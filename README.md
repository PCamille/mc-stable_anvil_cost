# Stable anvil costs

This mod changes the way that anvil costs are calculated and allow you to custom the tooltip color of the item.

- The cost only depends on the enchantments and their levels.
- Curses reduce the cost of a fusion.
- No more penalties applied when you enchant one item multiple times.
- Remove the cost limitation, no more 'Too expensive' message.
- Repair an item only cost material and no exp.
- Rename an item is free.
- Dye can be applied to a item to change its tooltip color.
